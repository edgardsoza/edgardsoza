- 👋 Hi, I’m @edgardsoza </br>
- 👀 I’m interested in new opportunities as a Fullstack Developer since I have experience with JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React, and ROR. </br>
- 🌱 I’m currently interested in learning Python since that was the first language I was interested in. </br>
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects you can have for me. I am a quick learner and I am open to new languages if required.</br>

- I don't like seafood. Weird, right?
